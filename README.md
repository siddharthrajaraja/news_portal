# news_portal
This is Indian Institute of Technology , Bombay , assignment-internship project to categorize News according to category.
This website basically focusses on converting dynamic flat file (.xlsx) to mongodb and is stored in cloud.
The website then fetches the data from cloud . The three collections 'News Data' , 'Cricket Scores' and 'Databases' are already included in the project.
Admin (Username: 12345 Password: 12345) logins in this website and uploads the excel file.
The processing of data is done accordingly as there exists (n) columns and (m) rows in the excel file.
Moreover apart from certain static attributes of the News Data all other attributes of all other collections are dynamic.
Cloud Storage for uploading files is not involved here !! So kindly clone the repository for inserting new Database for a different news section using PORT : 3500 .
Future development can be done using Amazon S3 buckets for file cloud storage.
